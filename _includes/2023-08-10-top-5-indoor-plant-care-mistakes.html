<h2>1. Overwatering 🚿</h2><p>One of the most common mistakes made by indoor plant enthusiasts is overwatering. While it's natural to want to keep your plant babies hydrated, too much water can lead to root rot and other fungal issues. Instead, check the moisture level of the soil before watering. Stick your finger about an inch deep into the soil - if it's dry, then it's time to water. 🌧️</p><h2>2. Ignoring Drainage 🚫</h2><p>Proper drainage is crucial for your indoor plants. Without it, excess water accumulates at the bottom of the pot, causing root problems. Ensure your pots have drainage holes, and consider using a well-draining potting mix. Elevating the pots slightly using pot feet can also help with drainage. 🪣</p><h2>3. Inadequate Light Exposure ☀️</h2><p>Each plant has its light requirements, and placing a shade-loving plant in direct sunlight or a sun-loving plant in a dark corner can spell disaster. Do some research on the light needs of your indoor plants and place them accordingly. If natural light is limited, consider using grow lights to supplement. 💡</p><h2>4. Neglecting Pest Prevention 🪲</h2><p>Pests like aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites can wreak havoc on your indoor plant collection. Regularly inspect your plants for signs of pests and take preventive measures, such as wiping leaves with a damp cloth or using natural insecticidal soap. Quarantine new plants before introducing them to your collection. 🐜</p><h2>5. Not Repotting When Needed 🪴</h2><p>Indoor plants grow, and as they do, they outgrow their pots. Root-bound plants can become stressed and struggle to thrive. Check for signs like roots circling the inside of the pot, slow growth, or the plant becoming top-heavy. When it's time, repot your plant into a slightly larger container with fresh soil. 🏺</p><p>Avoiding these common indoor plant care mistakes will go a long way in keeping your green friends happy and thriving.
