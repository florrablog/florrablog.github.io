    <p>Starting your journey as a plant enthusiast can be a rewarding experience, but it's essential to avoid common pitfalls that many beginners encounter. In this article, we'll explore the three most frequent plant care mistakes made by plant beginners and how to prevent them.</p>

    <h2>1. Overwatering</h2>
    <p>One of the most common mistakes among plant beginners is overwatering. It's easy to be too generous with watering, thinking it's good for your plants. However, most indoor plants prefer to dry out slightly between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot and other moisture-related issues. Be sure to check the specific watering needs of your plants and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.</p>

    <h2>2. Inadequate Light</h2>
    <p>Plants need light to thrive, and insufficient light is another common mistake. Placing your plants in dark corners or away from windows can lead to weak, leggy growth and poor health. Different plants have different light requirements, so it's essential to research the light needs of your specific plants and provide them with the appropriate amount of light. Consider using grow lights if natural light is limited.</p>

    <h2>3. Neglecting Pest Control</h2>
    <p>Pests can quickly become a problem if not addressed promptly. Beginners may not always notice the signs of pests or may underestimate their impact. Regularly inspect your plants for any unusual spots, webbing, or pests like aphids and spider mites. Implement preventive measures, and if you detect any issues, act promptly to control the infestation and prevent further damage.</p>
